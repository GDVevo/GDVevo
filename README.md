make a decorator that would cache fibonacci results and make the fibonacci start counting from the cached results? i've spent YEARS trying to make that happen and i still have zero idea how to implement this, how do you expect ME to do it?! i'll go INSANE trying to do this any longer, why do you want it to be real so badly?
